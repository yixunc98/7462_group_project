**What\'s new !!!**

1.  We imported the weather condition data for totally 9 selected cities (New York, Los Angeles, etc.) from April 30th 2022 to April 30th 2023, including 14 days of predictive condition. 

2.  We created our theme for the final version of the shiny app, including the set up of variables, the arrangement mode for our audience, and the list of our sidebar. 

3.  We switched the topic according to the professor\'s comments. We started to add plots and contents of our weather app. Using this app, the audience can easily obtain the weather condition the whole year in this city, the famous spot of this city, and the suggestion for travelers to the city. 

\

**What problems we have** **!!!**

1.  We still need to find dataset from more cities. Currently we only download the weather data for one city in the past two years. (We can only download the data from one city per day because the website we used will charge a fee for more data.)

2.  Since we change part of our product to recommend the user the famous spot in the city they chose, we need to collect the data about the interesting spots in each cities.

\

**What we need to do next  !!!**

1.  We need to download more weather data for different cities (we need 11 extra cities). We expected to include 20 cities which are selected by the ranking of the size of population in the US.

2.  Explore the data from the \`googleway\` and get the ranking information of the popular spots, following the instructions from: <https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/03/ranking-places-with-google-to-create-maps/>

3.  Create a box providing the information about the travel suggestions based on the month selected in the side bar for the specific city(the city clicked on the map).
